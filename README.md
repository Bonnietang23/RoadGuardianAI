## Get started


## Basic setting
Go into jetson-inference create data & images

## Dataset
A website that hosts a lot of different datasets. 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets

The datasets I chose
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sharansmenon/animals141

## ## Detect net
Code : / jetson-inference/project/ssd$ 
## Dataset literal table
https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/blob/master/data/networks/ssd_coco_labels.txt

This means because I use the detect net provided by NVIDIA.
So when testing, I have to use the provided items to test.

If you are having trouble with the training project on your nano, you can use this process as an alternative to training a custom network

You can adjust the code in time according to your own situation,
The required data can be found using the Kaggle I mentioned above.
